Last year, around this time, we [were thrilled to be presenting at JRubyConf EU
2014](/2014/07/join-us-at-jrubyconfeu/) and as luck would have it: [JRubyConf
EU](http://2015.jrubyconf.eu) is back, and so is Lookout! Lookout engineer [R.
Tyler Croy](https://github.com/rtyler) will be [presenting a talk on
JRuby/Gradle](http://2015.jrubyconf.eu/speakers/agentdero.html) at this year's
conference.

Tyler's talk "**JRuby/Gradle: Bringing Java powertools to Ruby**" will be the
second session of the day, and [according to the
abstract](http://unethicalblogger.com/2015/07/19/jrubyconfeu-jrubygradle.html):

> This talk will introduce the JRuby/Gradle project, an effort to combine the
> very best in Java tooling with the Ruby world, providing top-notch integration
> for JRuby devs. During the talk we will cover the motivations of the
> jruby-gradle project and describe how it helps bridge the gap between Java and
> Ruby. By combining the flexibility of JRuby with the power of Gradle, we can
> breathe new life into JRuby, opening it up to an even broader audience than
> before.


Another special part of this year's JRubyConf EU is that there will be a few of
Lookout's Europe-based hackers, including frequent JRuby contributor [Christian
Meier](https://github.com/mkristian), in attendance. JRuby users may recognize
his name, as he has built some of the most common tools of every JRuby
toolchain, such as [jbundler](https://github.com/mkristian/jbundler).




JRubyConf EU will be held as part of [Eurucamp](http://2015.eurucamp.org) on
**July 31st** in Potsdam, southwest of Berlin. Please join us to talk about
Ruby, JRuby, Lookout, mobile security and scalable systems!
